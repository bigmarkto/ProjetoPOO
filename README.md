## ⛩️ Project Overview

This project serves as a practical implementation of Object-Oriented Programming concepts using Java. It was developed to demonstrate proficiency in OOP principles including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

**Academic Context**: Developed for college practice 
**Language**: Java  
**Development Environment**: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com)  
**Java Version**: [Java 23]


## 🏗️ OOP Concepts Demonstrated

### Encapsulation 🔒
- Private fields with controlled access through getters and setters
- Data hiding and information security
- Proper access modifiers implementation

### Inheritance 🧬
- Base and derived class relationships
- Method overriding and `super` keyword usage
- Hierarchical class structure

### Polymorphism 🎭
- Method overloading
- Runtime polymorphism through method overriding
- Interface implementation for multiple inheritance

### Abstraction 🎯
- Abstract classes and methods
- Interface definitions and implementations
- Separation of interface from implementation

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- An IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans recommended)
- Git for version control

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**

   git clone https://github.com/bigmarkto/ProjetoPOO.git
   cd ProjetoPOO
   ```

2. **Import into your IDE**
   - Open your preferred Java IDE
   - Import the project as an existing project
   - Ensure JDK is properly configured

3. **Compile the project**
   ```bash
   javac -d bin src/**/*.java
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   java -cp bin Main
   ```
